## 🔎 Project Overview  
- **Objective**: Develop uncertainty-aware ML models to assess risk and improve decision-making reliability.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Applied **probabilistic models** to capture uncertainty in input features.  
  - Designed and tested multiple ML algorithms with simulation and real-world datasets.  
  - Benchmarked against standard deterministic models.  
- **Impact**: Delivered **25% higher predictive accuracy** and **30% better success rates** in high-variability conditions.
